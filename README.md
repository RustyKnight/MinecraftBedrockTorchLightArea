## Description

In 1.18 the mob spawning light level was reduced to 0, this means most mobs will not spawn if within a very large radius of a torch. This feature displays the horizontal lighted area of a torch.

## Taken from

[Bedrock Technical Resource Pack](https://github.com/RavinMaddHatter/Bedrock-Technical-Resource-Pack)

This strips out the feature into a standalone addon and updates it to support 1.19.30

## How To Use

To use this feature, place an armor stand on the block that you want to place a torch and equip the armor stand with a torch.

The colored diamond represents blocks that are not spawnable.

* Currently mobs still spawn on the light level 1 (orange) border of this feature. This mechanic might change in the future.
